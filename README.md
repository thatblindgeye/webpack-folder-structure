# Project Name

## Description

This is just my folder structure template for projects utilizing webpack. Whatever may be in these folders/files is just what I most recently had been testing out in practice and will either utilize in future projects or just test out some more. Some notes regarding packages, choices, etc:

**imagemin-cli:** installed this as a fallback in case I decide to forgo the file-loader or if file-loader stops working, and I want to still optimize images before bundling anything.

**cwebp and gif2webp:** installed these to convert images/gifs to the webp format, in case I decide to try using the picture tags with srcset attributes (offering webp for browsers that support it, and a jpg/png/gif for those that can't).
